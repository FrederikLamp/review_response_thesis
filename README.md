This repository holds example python code from the scripts used to fine-tune pretrained transformer models for both text 
classification and text generation tasks based on Danish review data collected from Trustpilot.

The TP_scrape.py and concatenate_reviews.py was used in data collection, and the notebooks were used in classification 
and text generation tasks, respectively.
